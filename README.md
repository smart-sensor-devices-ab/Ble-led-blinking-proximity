## Real-Time BLE Proximity-Based LED Blinking with BleuIO: A Practical Guide

In this example, we focus on monitoring the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) of a specific BLE device and controlling the LED blinking rate of BleuIO based on proximity. The closer the device, the faster the blinking rate. The script also ensures clean termination, turning off the LED when the program exits.
